## W1L2\_Micro & Macro Economics: The role of data

Summary: 1\) What is an economic activity?

* Any activity that drives the economy is called aneconomic activity.
* There are 5 real-time economic activities that take place simultaneously in an

  Economy, 1. Consumption 2. Production 3. Exchange4. Distribution 5. Investment.

2\) Who are the 3 groups of agents in the Economy? a. Producers - firms & enterprises b. Consumers - households c. Government - which is both a consumer and a producer

3\) What is the exchange and distribution type of economicactivity?

* Insimplisticterms,onecanimagineexchangeasaresourceandonesuchresourceis

  money.

* Firms and enterprises sell goods and services to consumers via exchange \(of

  money/resource\)

* Thisdistributionoftheexchangehasimplicationsoninvestmentandproduction,in

  other words every exchange has an underlying distributionof resources

4\) How are these 5 economic activities interrelated?

* Whenconsumersconsume,producersproduceandresourcesareexchangedamong

  them and this distribution of the exchange determines the investment and in turn

  determines the production capacity.

5\) How do these economic activities get affected byeach other? One of these economic activities, if affected, couldeventually affect all of them.

* For example duringthetimesof'Covid' Consumption\(ofgoods andservices\)got

  blocked that ledtoExchange\(flowofmoney\)getting blockedwhich inturn ledto

  Production getting affected severely.

6\) What is Micro Economics and Macro Economics discussed in the lecture?

* Economic activities at the levelofIndividuals,householdsandfirms comesunder

  microeconomicsandatthelevelofstate,nation,global,industrial,sectorial,usuallyin

  aggregated terms comes under macro economics.

7\) What is the role of data analysis at the microand the macro level

* Micro level: Atfirm level there aremany important parameters such asresource

  allocation, energy consumption, labour productivity, etc and every firm has data

  correspondingtothesecriticalparameters.Adataanalystwouldanalyzethisdataand

  provide useful insights to make important decisions leading to efficient resource

  allocation, optimal energy consumption, effectivelabour productivity, etc.

* Macro level: Data analysis for example can be done on national level data to

  understandbehavioralnatureofthevariousactivitiessuchasconsumptiontrendsetc

  and data analysis on such data can bring interesting behavioral insights. National

## W1L3\_Production, consumption and exchange

Summary: 1\) What is production and value addition during theproduction process?

* Productionisaprocessofconvertingrawmaterialsintousablegoods.-Theusability

  orusefulnessofthegoodobtainedhascertainvaluetoit-Henceproductionaddsthis

  value during its process from raw material to usefulgood

2\) What is the notion of utility?

* Utility is implicit to a commodity
* Any commodity without utility value will have notakers

3\) How does a producer determine what to produce andhow much to produce?

* Forproducers,severalimportantdatasuchaspricedata,realtimedata,continuous

  flow of data, resources data are important

* Thesekindsofdataleadtoanalyzingthedata,getusefulinsightstoanswerimportant

  questionslikewhatproductstoproduceincomingyears?Shouldweproducehighvalue

  low cost products? or a low value high cost product?

4\) How is the price the coordinating mechanism?

* Priceineconomicsactsasamechanismofcoordinatingdecisionssuchasbuyingand

  selling, it also plays the role of determination mechanismon both value and decisions.

5\) What is consumption and satisfaction during consumption?

* Consumption is consuming a good or service
* There would not be production, if there was no consumption
* The basic unit of consumption is a consumer
* A consumer consumes a good or service and derivessatisfaction upon consumption
* A producer always tries to maximize this satisfaction by using the consumer

  consumption data and gauging the consumer behavioralpatterns.

6\) What is consumption theory?

* A consumer has limited means\( income\) while theirwants could be unlimited
* Consumption theoryis formulationorgeneralizationofstandard relationshipsthat

  explain how consumers tend to behave. Eg: As priceincreases, demand decreases.

## W1L4\_Consumption baskets

Summary: 1\) What are the consumption and consumption baskets?

* Forexample,householdconsumptionoveradaycouldbeconsumptionofvegetables,

  electricity,water,data,etc.Ifwecancategorizealltheconsumptiontoadayorweekor

  monthwe callthem asconsumption baskets.Examplesof consumptionbasketsat

  household level are transportation, ration, electricity,rent, and etc.

* At household level 'monthly consumption basket' provides useful information in

  accessingthedemand.Foragivenincomebracketofseveralthousandsofhouseholds,

  these monthlyconsumptionbasketsgiveuspatterns on consumptionandtherefore

  provide even much better insight into gauging thecustomer behaviour and demand

2\) What are examples of different types of householdsand their consumption patterns

* Income of a householdforms the upper limit onspending andisalso termedas

  household budget. In the lecture 3 examples arepresented of householdsof 15k

  income\(9:07\) 30k income\(10:50\) and 50k income\(13:30\)

## W1L5\_Survey data

Summary: 1\) What is sampling, stratified sampling, and samplesize?

* Samplingisatechniqueofselectingindividualmembersorasubsetofthepopulation

  to make statistical inferences from them.

* Stratifiedsamplingisamethodwhereyoursamplingismodeledbasedondifferent

  strata such as income, region , occupation etc.

* Sampling data and sample size should be representativeof the entire population.

2\) What are the 2 kinds of biases from consumptionsurvey data?

* 1.Biasduetotimingofthesurvey:Itisquintessentialtodothesurveyallacrossthe

  country at the same time of the date to avoid thiskind of bias.

* 2.RecallBias:itisbiasthatarisesduringasurveywhentheparticipanthastorecall

  his consumption history for a week or month.

3\) Why do we need high frequency consumption data?

* Datapertainingtoacertainlistofcommoditiesthatareconsumedinhigherfrequency

  \(recurring\) are termed as high frequency consumptiondata.

* After1991,majoreconomicreforms,Indiahasseenanincreaseinchoiceofgoods

  andservices,andthisledtounpredictabilityinconsumptiondataon thegoodsand

  services. To address this, GOI came up with high frequency consumption data

  pertaining to it.

4\) Which trends in consumer expenditure over the yearsare shown in the lecture? Composition of consumer expenditure 1993-1994:7: Composition of consumer expenditure 1993-2011:8: Break-up of rural and urban expenditure 2011-2012:12: Relationship between income and poverty:14:

## W1L6\_Utility and prices: An introduction

Summary: 1\) What is the notion of utility and its effect onconsumers' choice?

* Utility is often seen in terms of utility valueof good or service to be purchased
* Consumergenerallyisawareortriestogaugetheutilityvalueofapotentialgoodor

  service looking to be consumed

* Utilityissubjective,theutilityvaluemaydifferfromoneindividualtoanother.Eg:A

  certainindividualmayhaveahighutilityvaluetowatchthemovieonthefirstdayandis

willingtopayapremiumpriceandacertainotherindividualmayhavelesserutilityvalue for the same.

* Utilitydrivesconsumer'schoice:everyhouseholdhasanincome,whichactsasthe

  upper limit. The household has to operate within this budget constraint. So the

  householdpurchasingisdeterminedbythevariousconsumerchoiceshehasathand

  andwhatutilityvaluethosechoicesprovideandwhichofthosetoexercisebasedon

  priority of the household.

2\) How does price act as the rationing device?

* Imagineagoodwhosevalueisfree,sobeingthatway\(free\)theconsumptioncould

  more likely be unlimited and therefore over time it'svalue diminishes.

* In order to avoid this 'price' plays an importantrole; every good and service has a price.
* Priceusually servesasarationalizingdevicewherebytheiruseiskeptdowntothe

  available supply.

## W1L7\_Other sources of survey data

Summary: 1\) What is/are the limitations of large scale nationalsample surveys?

* Large scale sample surveys from official sources have alimitation that the data

  availability is not in regular intervals

2\) What are CMIE consumer pyramid household surveysand what are its advantages?

* It is A product by the Centre for Monitoring IndianEconomy Pvt. Ltd.
* They conducts waves of surveys on Indian households
* Current wave as of sep-dec 2021 is 26th surveyedon 236,000 people

  Advantages:

* This is a continuous type of survey \(periodic waves\)
* It has good coverage \(currently: 236,000\)
* The data obtained by the survey is of type 'longitudinal'

3\) What is an example of longitudinal data?

* Surveyconductedonahousehold 3 timesayearandhavebeenconductingforthe

  past several years. The data obtainedon suchhouseholds over the time is called

  longitudinal data.

  consumption, consumption basket diversification, incomes, which goods became

  inferior over time, etc.

4\) What are the different types of data discussedin the lecture?

* 1.Timeseriesdata:Itisdatacollectedatdifferentpointsintime.Thesedatapoints

  typicallyconsistofsuccessivemeasurementsmadefromthesamesourceoveratime

5\)Whatistheimportanceofmarketresearchobtainedfromsurveysbyconsultingfirms ?

* From a firm standpoint, specific surveys act both as market intelligence and

  forecasting

* Surveys act as inputs for strategic decision makingfor firms.
* Firmscanlookatthetrendsoftodayandbeabletoplantopositionthemselves 5 or

  10 years from today to meet the demands by calibratingtheir supplies.

* Surveysareasource fordemandinformationandcanhelpinunderstandingwhere
